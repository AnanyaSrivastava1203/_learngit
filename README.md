Hey there .. this is my first git file. I'm learning how to use git and github
It's commands are:
1) git clone <copied link of repository>
2) git status :-to find the status of everything
3) git branch :-branches present and '*' before the current branch where we are present
4) git branch <branch name> :-to add a new branch
5) git checkout <branch name> :-to switch to another branch
   staging area:-state of a file where changes done are not permanent
6) git add ./<filename> :-to add a file in the staging area
7) git commit -m "<message>" :-to save the changes in the staging area
8) git merge <branchname> :-to merge a particular branch in its parent branch
9) git push :-to show all the changes of that particular branch in the github
10) git pull :-to update the changes in local storage from github
